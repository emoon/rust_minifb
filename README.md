minifb is a cross platform library written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and that makes it easy to setup a window and to (optional) display a 32-bit pixel buffer.  It also makes it easy to get input from keyboard and mouse.
An example is the best way to show how it works:

[Changelog](https://github.com/emoon/rust_minifb/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

Usage
-----

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
minifb = "0.16"
```

Example
-------

```rust
extern crate minifb;

use minifb::{Key, Window, WindowOptions};

const WIDTH: usize = 640;
const HEIGHT: usize = 360;

fn main() {
    let mut buffer: Vec<u32> = vec![0; WIDTH * HEIGHT];

    let mut window = Window::new(
        "Test - ESC to exit",
        WIDTH,
        HEIGHT,
        WindowOptions::default(),
    )
    .unwrap_or_else(|e| {
        panic!("{}", e);
    });

    // Limit to max ~60 fps update rate
    window.limit_update_rate(Some(std::time::Duration::from_micros(16600)));

    while window.is_open() && !window.is_key_down(Key::Escape) {
        for i in buffer.iter_mut() {
            *i = 0; // write something more funny here!
        }

        // We unwrap here as we want this code to exit if it fails. Real applications may want to handle this in a different way
        window
            .update_with_buffer(&buffer, WIDTH, HEIGHT)
            .unwrap();
    }
}
```

Status
------
Currently macOS, Linux and Windows (64-bit and 32-bit) are the current supported platforms. X11 (Linux/FreeBSD/etc) support has been tested on Ubuntu (x64). Bug report(s) for other OSes/CPUs are welcome!
Notice: That after 0.13 Redox hasn't been updated and some work is required to get that working again. PR are welcome.

Build instructions
------------------

```
cargo build
